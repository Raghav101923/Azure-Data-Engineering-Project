This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering workflow leveraging modern Azure technologies. 
The implementation focuses on building a robust and scalable data pipeline for data integration, transformation, and analytics.

üìã Overview

In this project, we integrate data from multiple sources, perform transformations, and build a data warehouse for analytics using Azure services. Below are the technologies and tools used in this project:

      Azure Data Factory: For data ingestion and orchestration.
      
      Azure Data Lake Gen2: For storing raw and transformed data efficiently.
      
      Azure Databricks: For data transformation and big data analytics using Apache Spark.
      
      Azure Synapse Analytics: For data warehousing and analytical processing.
      
      Power BI: For reporting and visualizing insights.


üõ† Data Architecture

The pipeline comprises the following key components:  

 Data Source:
      
     Data is sourced from a public GitHub repository containing AdventureWorks datasets (2015-2017).
        
     The data is uploaded in raw format and accessed via an HTTP URL.
    
 Data Ingestion:
    
     Azure Data Factory (ADF) orchestrates the ingestion process.
      
     Raw data is stored in Azure Data Lake Gen2 for better scalability and performance compared to traditional Blob Storage.
      
 Data Transformation:
    
     Azure Databricks is used to process the raw data and perform transformations.
        
     Transformations include cleaning, aggregating, and structuring the data using PySpark and Apache Spark.
    
 Serving Layer:
    
     The transformed data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for data warehousing.
        
     Synapse provides tools like OPENROWSET and external tables to enable seamless integration.
    
 Reporting:
    
     Power BI connects to Synapse Analytics to create dashboards and reports, enabling business intelligence and decision-making.
      

üîç Detailed Workflow

1. Data Understanding

        Dataset: AdventureWorks (2015-2017) available on GitHub.
        
        Data Characteristics: Contains multiple tables for products, sales, customers, etc.

        Access: Data is pulled from raw HTTP URLs and ingested using Azure Data Factory.

2. Data Ingestion (Level 1)

        Creating Azure Resources: Setup Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Gen2, and other required resources.
        
        Azure Data Factory Pipelines: Create ETL pipelines to ingest raw data into Data Lake Gen2.
        
        Advantages of Azure Data Lake Gen2: Scalability and cost-efficiency.
        
        Optimized for analytics workloads and hierarchical namespaces.

3. Data Transformation (Level 2)

        Azure Databricks: A Databricks cluster is configured for transformation tasks.
        
        Data is processed using PySpark for efficient handling of big data.
        
        Apache Spark: Perform distributed computing for large-scale transformations.
        
        Real-Time Scenarios: Clean, aggregate, and join tables for analytics use cases.

4. Azure Synapse Analytics (Level 3)

        Integration: Transformed data is moved to Synapse for storage in external tables.
        
        Features: Use OPENROWSET() for querying external tables.
        
        Build a central data warehouse for fast and scalable analytics.

5. Reporting and Visualization
        
        Power BI: Synapse serves as the backend for Power BI dashboards.
        
        Create interactive reports for business insights.

üèÜ Highlights of Technologies Used

        Azure Data Factory: Simplifies data ingestion and ETL orchestration.
        
        Azure Data Lake Gen2: Enables a scalable and cost-effective data lake architecture.
        
        Azure Databricks: Provides a unified platform for data analytics and transformation.
        
        Apache Spark: Allows distributed data processing and big data analytics.
        
        Azure Synapse Analytics: Integrates data warehousing and big data solutions.
        
        Power BI: Delivers impactful reporting and visualizations.

I would be working on the visualization part in PowerBI, this project is solely for transfroemation of data using Azure platform which is end-to-end but it feels incomplete to leave this project without any visualization part at the end. So stay updated with my profile the visualization part would be out in the next month concluding this project.

Until then ping me me if you have doubts regarding this project!
