# End-to-End Data Engineering Workflow with Azure

## üìã Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering workflow leveraging modern Azure technologies. It focuses on building a robust and scalable data pipeline for data integration, transformation, and analytics.

### Technologies and Tools Used:

- **Azure Data Factory**: For data ingestion and orchestration.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**: For efficient storage of raw and transformed data.
- **Azure Databricks**: For data transformation and big data analytics using Apache Spark.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For data warehousing and analytical processing.
- **Power BI**: For reporting and visualizing insights (coming soon).

## üõ† Data Architecture

The pipeline is structured into the following key components:

### Data Source:

- Data is sourced from a public GitHub repository containing **AdventureWorks datasets (2015-2017)**.
- The raw data is uploaded and accessed via an HTTP URL.

### Data Ingestion:

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** orchestrates the ingestion process.
- Raw data is stored in **Azure Data Lake Gen2**, providing better scalability and performance compared to traditional Blob Storage.

### Data Transformation:

- **Azure Databricks** processes the raw data and performs transformations.
- Transformations include:
  - Cleaning.
  - Aggregating.
  - Structuring the data using PySpark and Apache Spark.

### Serving Layer:

- Transformed data is loaded into **Azure Synapse Analytics** for data warehousing.
- Synapse provides tools like `OPENROWSET` and external tables for seamless integration.

### Reporting:

- **Power BI** connects to Synapse Analytics to create dashboards and reports, enabling business intelligence and decision-making.

## üîç Detailed Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding

- **Dataset**: AdventureWorks (2015-2017) from GitHub.
- **Data Characteristics**: Includes tables for products, sales, customers, etc.
- **Access**: Data is pulled from HTTP URLs and ingested via Azure Data Factory.

### 2. Data Ingestion (Level 1)

- **Azure Resources**: Setup Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Gen2, and other required resources.
- **ADF Pipelines**: Create ETL pipelines to ingest raw data into Data Lake Gen2.
- **Advantages of Data Lake Gen2**:
  - Scalability and cost-efficiency.
  - Optimized for analytics workloads with hierarchical namespaces.

### 3. Data Transformation (Level 2)

- **Azure Databricks**: Configured for transformation tasks.
- **Processing**:
  - Use PySpark for big data handling.
  - Perform distributed computing with Apache Spark.
- **Real-Time Scenarios**: Clean, aggregate, and join tables for analytics use cases.

### 4. Azure Synapse Analytics (Level 3)

- **Integration**: Transformed data is moved to Synapse and stored in external tables.
- **Features**: Use `OPENROWSET()` for querying external tables.
- **Purpose**: Build a central data warehouse for fast and scalable analytics.

### 5. Reporting and Visualization

- **Power BI**: Synapse serves as the backend for Power BI dashboards.
- **Output**: Interactive reports for business insights.

## üí° Key Learnings and Concepts

- Designing scalable data pipelines using **Azure Data Factory**.
- Best practices for big data processing with **Azure Data Lake** and **Databricks**.
- Efficient warehousing and reporting with **Synapse Analytics**.
- Mastery of **PySpark** for big data analytics.
- Integration of **Power BI** with Synapse for impactful visualizations.

## üèÜ Highlights of Technologies Used

- **Azure Data Factory**: Simplifies data ingestion and ETL orchestration.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**: Enables scalable and cost-effective data lake architecture.
- **Azure Databricks**: Unified platform for data analytics and transformation.
- **Apache Spark**: Facilitates distributed data processing for large-scale analytics.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Combines data warehousing and big data solutions.
- **Power BI**: Provides dynamic and interactive reporting capabilities.

## Next Steps: Power BI Visualizations

Currently, this project focuses on the transformation and integration of data using the Azure platform. However, visualization is an essential part of data engineering workflows. I will be working on the Power BI visualizations next month to provide a comprehensive conclusion to this project.
